Merchants record their daily sales, stock, and invoice details, and accounts in notebooks. They always used to check their previous account books and also have to remind the consumers about their dues.
To make this process effective way An Android application can be designed to save time by tracking bills and consumer dues digitally, sending payment reminders to the customers, to maintain the cash flow of glover and billings to the Dealer.  It helps the vendors to send reminders to the consumers before the deadline including their due amount.
It also enables records of daily sales and alerts about the stock summary. This Application reminds the merchants about their dealings with the suppliers.
